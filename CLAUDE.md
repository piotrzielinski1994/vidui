# VidUI

Briefing for Claude Code. Read [README.md](README.md) first - setup, commands, repo layout. This file lists conventions and the non-obvious bits not visible from reading individual files.

## Communication

- Keep replies short and to the point. No filler, no pleasantries, no recap of what the user just said.
- Status updates fit in one or two sentences.

## UI / design

- Read [docs/design.md](docs/design.md) before any UI change - it's the visual contract, shared verbatim with the `requi` and `dbui` repos to keep all three consistent. Key rule: **no rounded corners anywhere** (`--radius` and every `--radius-*` pinned to `0rem` in `index.css`); don't raise them or add `rounded-full` / `rounded-xs` / `rounded-[..]` (token-based `rounded-{sm,md,lg}` resolve to 0 so are tolerated, but prefer stripping). Buttons in a thin bar (the transport bar) fill the bar's full height, square, divided by a 1px border - not floating chips with their own height/padding (see `transport-bar.tsx` `BAR_BUTTON`).
- Keep design.md in sync with `requi`/`dbui` when the shared contract changes; vidui-only rules can be added but mark them as such.

## Learning from conversation

If during a session you learn something project-specific that future-you would otherwise have to re-derive - a non-obvious convention the user prefers, a constraint that bit us, a gotcha worth recording - append it to [docs/learnings.md](docs/learnings.md). Examples: formatting rules the user repeated, gotchas that broke a hook/CI, naming conventions enforced via review.

For architectural trade-offs (significant, costly-to-reverse, or contested choices) use [docs/adr.md](docs/adr.md) instead - that's a separate log.

Don't add: one-off task context, debugging notes, things obvious from the code itself, or anything that would fit better in [README.md](README.md). Don't ask permission for small additions - just keep the file tight and the diff visible in the next commit.

## Features

- Each feature lives in its own folder: `docs/features/<timestamp>-<slug>/`.
  - `<timestamp>` = `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` (creation time). `<slug>` = short kebab-case name.
  - Example: `docs/features/20260618193518-bootstrap/`.
- Every feature folder holds two files:
  - `spec.md` - what + why. Follows the spec template structure (overview, acceptance criteria, user test cases, data model, edge cases, dependencies).
  - `plan.md` - how. Follows the plan template structure (task breakdown, execution order, file changes, acceptance verification).
- Adding a new feature:
  1. Create the folder with current timestamp + slug.
  2. Write `spec.md` first. Get it approved before planning.
  3. Write `plan.md` from the approved spec.
  4. Log any significant choices made while specing to [docs/adr.md](docs/adr.md).
- Branch naming: when working on a feature (not a quick fix), the branch name must match the feature's folder name under `docs/features/` exactly (e.g. folder `20260618223203-layout` -> branch `20260618223203-layout`). Quick fixes are exempt.

## Architectural Decisions

- Log only significant, costly-to-reverse or contested decisions to [docs/adr.md](docs/adr.md).
- Significant = changes architecture/data model, hard to undo later, or had real alternatives debated. NOT routine config (script aliases, package manager, default lib options).

## Before committing

- Check whether the change makes README.md or CLAUDE.md drift:
  - New script / removed dependency / renamed module -> update README.
  - New convention or gotcha that future-you would miss -> add to CLAUDE.md (or docs/learnings.md).
  - Removed feature or file referenced in either doc -> remove the reference.
- No duplicates between README.md and CLAUDE.md. Each fact lives in exactly one place:
  - README.md = onboarding facts a human needs to run the app: install steps, commands, repo layout sketch.
  - CLAUDE.md = working rules for an agent editing this repo: conventions, gotchas, "how to add a feature", invariants.
  - If a fact would fit both, put it in CLAUDE.md and link from README only if a human reader needs the pointer.
- If neither doc needs to change, say so explicitly in the pre-commit summary so it's a deliberate decision, not an oversight.

## TDD

Write code red-green-refactor:

1. Red - add a failing test that pins the behaviour you want. Run the relevant suite and confirm it fails for the right reason (not a typo, not a missing import).
2. Green - write the smallest production change that makes it pass. No speculative branches, no helper extraction yet.
3. Refactor - once green, clean up names, extract duplication, tighten types. Tests stay green throughout.

Two test layers, pick the one that owns the behaviour:
- Frontend (React/TS) -> `npm test` (Vitest).
- Rust backend / Tauri commands -> `cargo test` in `src-tauri/`.

Don't skip red. A test that's never seen failing is a test you can't trust. Don't refactor on red - get to green first, then improve.
